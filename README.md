# ☕ AR Cafe Experience – Augmented Reality Website for Smart Cafe Management

## 📌 Project Overview

**AR Cafe Experience** is a web-based application designed to revolutionize the way customers interact with cafes. By integrating **Augmented Reality (AR)** into the dining experience, this platform simplifies table booking, ordering, and dish visualization, making the entire process seamless and engaging.

## 🚀 Features

- **Table Booking System**  
  Customers can book a table upon entering the cafe using the website interface.

- **Smart Ordering via Scanner**  
  Each table is equipped with a scanner. Customers scan it to access the digital menu and place their orders.

- **AR Visualization of Dishes**  
  Many customers struggle to understand dishes by name alone. This platform solves that by offering AR previews of each dish, helping customers make informed choices.

- **Automated Billing**  
  Once the order is placed and served, the system generates a digital bill for the customer.

- **Admin Dashboard**  
  The admin panel allows cafe managers to:
  - Monitor table bookings
  - Manage menu items and AR models
  - Track orders and billing
  - View analytics and customer feedback

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (optional)
- **Backend:** Node.js / Python / PHP (based on your implementation)
- **Database:** MySQL / MongoDB
- **AR Integration:** WebAR / Unity WebGL / 8thWall (or any AR SDK used)
- **Authentication:** JWT / OAuth (if applicable)

## 📷 How It Works

1. **Customer Entry:**  
   On entering the cafe, customers access the website via QR code or kiosk.

2. **Table Booking:**  
   They select and book a table from the available options.

3. **Order Placement:**  
   At the table, they scan the provided scanner to open the menu.

4. **AR Dish Preview:**  
   Each dish has an AR model that customers can view before ordering.

5. **Billing:**  
   After dining, the system generates a bill and sends it to the customer.

6. **Admin Control:**  
   Admins manage all operations from a centralized dashboard.
